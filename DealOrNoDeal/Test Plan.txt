By now you should be able to author a test plan for a problem like this.

Here is a template to use:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcXgqO7OyFlWA0xEMcOuKWi4y3WeoYfDMH-e8dwdXVY/edit

Make a copy of that document and author a test plan.

Possible way to use time in class - pair up with a partner.

One person works on implementing a solution in code.

The other person works on a test plan.
